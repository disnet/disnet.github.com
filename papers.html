            <h2>MedIX Papers</h2>

            <p>During the summer of 2006 I had the opportunity to take part in a research experience for undergrads (REU) program at <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul</a> university in Chicago called <a href="http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix/">MedIX</a>. It was an incredibly productive summer and during that time my teammates and I were able to both develop an open source medical imaging system called <a href="http://brisc.sourceforge.net/">BRISC</a> and publish several papers related to the system.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/publications/brisc_paper_final.pdf">BRISC - An Open Source Pulmonary Nodule Image Retrieval Framework</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/publications/scarpaper_MIke_Tim2007.pdf">A Lookup and Reference Tool for Pulmonary Computed Tomography Nodules</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/publications/SPIE07_SusomboonMailanTim-Final.pdf">A Comparison of Texture Models for Automatic Liver Segmentation</a></li>
