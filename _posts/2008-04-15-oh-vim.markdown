So you may recall my recent conundrum with searching for a decent text editor in OS X. Well, the truth is there really is only one text editor and its name is vi(m).

I pretty much cannot live without vi keybindings. I tried, I really did. OS X actually uses a subset of emacs like bindings for just about every native text entry box which is better than nothing. But the unnatural and ridiculously frustrating finger contortions quickly drove me away.

I tried to find a way to get vi keys in other editors with out much success. I found [this](http://www.corsofamily.net/jcorso/vi/ "Vi Input Manager") which adds _some_ vi keys to _some_ text editors in OS X (XCode was one) but sadly not the one I cared about, TextMate.

To be honest I've become even more enamored with vim since finding [vimpress](http://friggeri.net/blog/2007/07/13/vimpress "Vimpress") which is allowing me to write and post this entry to my wordpress blog all in vim! Now that's what I call sweet sweetness :)
