  <li>The probably of God's existence is one in two 
  (since God either exists or doesn't exist).
</li>
  <li>The probability that God became incarnate is 
  also one in two (since it either happened or it didn't).
  </li>
  <li>The evidence for God's existence is an argument for the resurrection.
  </li>
  <li>The chance of Christ's resurrection not being reported by the gospels has 
  a probability of one in 10.
  </li>
  <li>Considering all these factors together, there is a one in 1,000 chance that the 
  resurrection is not true.
