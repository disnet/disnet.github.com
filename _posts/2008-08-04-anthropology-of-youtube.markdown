So, I've never given YouTube much thought (never really felt it
deserved much thought either) consigning it as a fun if trivial place to see stupid
videos of dogs and skateboards (like [OMG!!!
ROLFLCOPTER!!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzUsTFqtW0)). Amusing,
to be sure but not serious or worthwhile.

But then Mike Wesch of [The Machine is Us/ing
Us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE) fame changed my mind
with [An anthropological introduction to
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU&feature=user). It's
a bit long (50 min) but definitely worth it if you are at all
interested in web culture. What's amazing here is he has gone beyond
the trivial examples of YouTube (while still embracing what most of us
consider trivial -- he dedicated the video to Gary Brolsma aka the numa
numa guy) and show us the community that has formed through vlogs. He
has some pretty profound statements about how that culture is shaped by
the medium (webcams) and how if reflects the wider culture as a whole.

Great stuff and well worth a watch.
