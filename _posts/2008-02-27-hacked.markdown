My apologies to anyone trying to access my site in the past few days. Apparently the server my site and blog are being hosted on was hacked -- something to do with a vmsplice() system call. A bunch of index.html files were defaced before the admins put up some generic replacements. So, if you had tried to hit my site yesterday all you would have seen was a page saying that apache was running. <br /><br />Anyhow, it should be all back up now.<br />
