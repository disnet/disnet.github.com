So it looks like the Ubiquity verb I recently wrote and posted about
doesn't work in the new version of Ubiquity. I'll get around to fixing
it eventually but until Ubiquity become less of a moving target I probably
won't be spending too much time on it.

In other news the new
[roadmap](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/0.2_Roadmap_Proposals)
to version 0.2 shows a lot of promise. It looks like they're planning on
integration with the awesome bar and eventually standalone desktop
integration. [Enso](http://www.humanized.com/) is dead, long live enso!
