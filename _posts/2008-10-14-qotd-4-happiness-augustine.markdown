What I find fascinating here is that Augustine is describing the pursuit
of happiness as the pursuit of a memory. It's a state of being we are
trying to get back to. A state we are rarely at but always long
for. A place we remember.

Can we say that all of life's pursuits are in search of a memory? Since how
could we pursue something we have no knowledge or experience (memory) of?
Are we always trying to regain the bit of paradise, joy, happiness we
once experienced? And once we attain it, seek it again and again?
