Google just recently <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/fly-me-to-moon.html">announced</a> the <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">lunar x-prize!</a> It's a contest to help spur the private sector to get us back to the moon. It involves $30 Million in prizes for the group that successfully puts a rover on the moon.<br /><br />This is a pretty exciting time for space exploration. Even NASA seems to be getting their act together after years of piddling around (I wanted <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0062622/">2001</a> in 2001!) with plans to put a man back on the moon by 2018 and a permanent moon base by 2024. <br /><br />It'll be pretty interesting to see what private competition will do for space.
