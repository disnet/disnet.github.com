[\*JS][stjs] is a really cool (if ungoogleable) project that attempts
to be "the bastard child of JavaScript and C" by giving you the low
level tools to build fast programs in a high level language.

After the recent excitement surrounding Bret Victor's
[amazing talk][invent], Jonathan Edwards has a [sobering essay][ide]
about the limits of IDE innovation. Makes the point that languages
must co-evolve to get real innovation.

Wired has a [nice writeup][hacked] on the current state of computer security
(spoiler: it sucks) and
The New Yorker has a [great article][geohotz] on the recent geohot vs. Sony
craziness.
