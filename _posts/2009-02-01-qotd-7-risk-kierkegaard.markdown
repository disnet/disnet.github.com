>Without risk there is no faith. Faith is precisely the contradiction between the infinite passion of the individual's inwardness and the objective uncertainty. If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself in faith I must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty, so as to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.

>--Soren Kierkegaard

I just went skydiving today (which was awesome!) and thought this quote might be somewhat apropos. Though we should probably change seventy thousand fathoms of water to seven thousand feet of air :)
