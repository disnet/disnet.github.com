So, I've just recently discovered that hard drives are dirt cheep. While I've known this in principle for some time now, I didn't realize just how cheep they've become. You can get over 300GB (SATA 3.0, 7200rpm, 16mb cache etc.) for under $100.

This recent discovery has convinced me that I need a data server (note the keyword <em>need</em>). My desktop has been in want of an upgrade anyway (it's been with me for over four years) and now seems like the perfect time.

I'm thinking of hooking four of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148140">these</a> up to raid 5 which should give me something like 900GB all wonderfully recoverable in the event of catastrophic hard drive failure.

What would I do with all this space you ask? Why store all my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webvo/">webvo</a>'ed shows of course! In case you didn't know webvo is a web-based PVR system me and a few friends have been working on since last fall. Development slowed during spring (school and all that) but we've just about finished some major changes to make things even better.
