title: Occupying Language Design at POPL
---

At POPL last week I gave a student lightning talk on 
our Virtual Values [paper](/papers/virtual-values-for-language-extension).
The format was four minutes with the slides advancing every 20 seconds. Very
difficult to communicate the important idea in so short a time but it was
really fun and I think turned out pretty well.

Check out the [slides](/talks/virtual_values_lightning.pdf) if you're interested. I added notes on
each slide that corresponded more or less to what I was saying.
