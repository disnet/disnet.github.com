Just in case you haven't heard about it yet, I thought I would carve out a little time today to write about Google Reader. Though it already been covered <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/productivity/read-hundreds-of-feeds-with-google-reader-263854.php">many</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/google-reader/hack-attack-getting-good-with-google-reader-233712.php"> times</a> <a href="http://www.hackszine.com/blog/archive/2007/05/how_scoble_reads_622_rss_feeds.html?CMP=OTC-7G2N43923558"> over</a>, I've found it so incredibly useful it bears repeating.

GReader is the one application that actually made me truly appreciate the power of RSS. I've been aware of the existence of feeds for quite a while and even tried various feed readers over the years. While I've like the idea of it (and the stumbling steps towards the semantic web that it represents) I've never actually used a feed reader as a replacement for the browser. Until now...

Most of my news before GReader was actually coming from slashdot. While /. is fun and amazing, you do get a rather one sided view of the tech world. And the tech world alone pretty much, not much room for anything else.

Once I started using GReader I was amazed at how much news I could keep up with in such a short amount of time. I spend maybe a half hour a day and I'm able to keep up with 48 subscriptions. And according to google reader I've read 4,793 items in the past 30 days. All the important/useful post I put on my "Shared Items" list <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10222338796708253618">here</a>. Feel free to put that in your rss reader and read it!
