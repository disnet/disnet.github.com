A new version of contracts.coffee is up on npm. We're now synced with
the latest release version of CoffeeScript (1.3.1) and have collected
a few bug fixes. We also have experimental require.js/AMD support.
Change log [here](http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/#log).

Get it with `npm install contracts.coffee`.
