[Lots][classwar] of [discussion][tc30] around classes and
other changes being considered for the future of JavaScript.
Interesting how difficult it has been for the standardization
committee (or the JS community in general) to come to a consensus on
what classes should look like (or if they should even exist).

In what is almost becoming a weekly story, [emscripten has been used to
impressive effect again][jsjs]. This time SpiderMonkey (the JS engine in
Firefox) has been compiled to JavaScript. 

Finally, an
[explanation of why Lispâ€™s syntax is so important and useful][lisp] 
that finally clicked for me. The key: "it's possible to *read* it
without *parsing*."

The [greatest language in the world][semi] has been made. PL is done,
we can all go home now.
