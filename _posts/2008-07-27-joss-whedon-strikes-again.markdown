For those of you itching to get your Joss Whedon fix (you
know...the guy who only just gave us *Firefly*!), you might want to
checkout [Dr. Horrible](http://drhorrible.com). It's an amazing show
that defies categorization (actually, it's pretty easy to categorize
this as a musical, but don't let that turn you off). Amazing,
hillarious...go watch it.

As an added bonus it was produced online entirely outside of the big
studios which Whedon has good reason to be weary of after they axed
what was perhaps the best shows ever made for television (granted
that's not necessarily saying a lot...but Firfly was amazing!). If
Dr. Horrible is successful (and it's definitely worthy of success) than maybe we
can start seeing more shows created outside the "system". This would
be nothing but good to my mind.
