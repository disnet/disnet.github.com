Just thought you should all know that <a href="http://brisc.sf.net">BRISC</a> (the coolest content-based image retrieval project I've ever worked on in summer '06!) got a writeup in <a href="http://www.dimag.com/pacsweb/newsupdate/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202804064">PACSweb</a>. Mike (the inimitable <a href="http://freearrow.com/blog/">FreeArrow</a>) was quoted at length (sweet!).<br /><br />I'm disappointed though, they got the acronym wrong. <b>B</b>risc <b>R</b>eally <b>Is</b> <b>C</b>ool is completely professional sounding! <br /><br />
