All I can say is wow: <a href="http://www.godtube.com/">http://www.godtube.com/</a>

So, now we Christians have a way to "Broadcast Him" to the teaming masses. I guess it wouldn't be quite so painful if the interface wasn't a complete clone of YouTube. Come on guys! If you're going to ride in on the coat tails of YouTube at least change the interface up a bit!

And you might want to watch out for YouTube's (i.e. Google's) lawyers. They might get a bit touchy with the whole name thing.

One of my friends thinks (and I'm inclined to agree with him) that GodTube is a perfect example of all that's wrong with Christian "culture" in America. It takes what's going on in the larger culture, slaps Jesus' name on it, and presto! It's Christian! It's not even a counter-culture. It's a soulless clone.

So, what's next? GodSpace? MyChurch? IslamTube?
