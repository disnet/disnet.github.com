Gizmodo has a surprisingly well-reasoned [critique][goog] of Google.
Far better than the usual knee-jerk Google bashing that 
too often passes for criticism online these days.

[Kony 2012][1] has probably done more for [raising][2] the [discourse][3] [on][4]
[US][5] ["aid"][6] than its stated goal (killing a guy... er, I mean "raising awareness").
Also, [Žižek][zizek].

[Looks like the web lost the video (H.264) battle][vid]. Lame.

A fantastic [retrospective][ret] on [BitC][bitc] with some echoing
[comments from the Rust team][rust].

Fear not! [The proof is trivial][proof].
