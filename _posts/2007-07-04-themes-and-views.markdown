You may have noticed my recent penchant for theme changes lately. For those following I have changed the theme of disnetdev just about every time I post. However, I feel like I've finally ended my wandering ways and you should no longer be confused each time you visit.

For those interested I actually have another blog I will eventually start posting to over at <a href="http://dandelionsublime.groups.vox.com/">vox</a>. A few friends and I will be reading some pretty sweet books and then discussing them using the wondrous power of technology. The idea of that blog will be to read through some of the staples of western thought, from Aristotle to Nietzsche. And, because we like pain, we will be starting with Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>.

Oh. Dear. God.

I'll keep writting with a technical focus on disnetdev so no worries, this won't die. I intend to post with a little more regularity since I actually have time now. So far so good; two posts within a week! Very nice, as Borat would say.
