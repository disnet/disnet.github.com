[Details surface about Google's project Glass][1]. The future is now
and all that. [Rainbows End][2] and [Daemon][3]/[Freedom&trade;][4]
are now required reading.

I didn't realize when I first saw it but xkcd's April 1st comic was
actually quite [brilliant][xkcd].

Some [good advice on giving academic talks][talk] under the twin
lenses of memory (your audience's resource &mdash; build context and 
be wary of details) and fear (your resource &mdash; desensitize and
dissociate).

An [interesting privacy hack][priv] for the web was announced and
[kickstarted][privk]. 
Amusingly enough they use Libya's [ccTLD][tld] ([.ir][ir] or [.eg][eg] would also have
been apropos). Hopefully they've thought about domain seizures. 

And on a related note, [here's a good read on the internet wars][war].
In particular the forces of order (SOPA/PIPA, Iran, China, Egypt,
etc.) vs. the forces of chaos (Anonymous, LulzSec, etc.).
