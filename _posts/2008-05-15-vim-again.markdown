So this will be the last post on vim for a while (I'm not obsessed really!) but I thought you all should know about [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ "MacVim") (not to be confused with [Mac Vim](http://macvim.org/ "Mac Vim")). It's a project aimed at integrating better with OS X than the standard port. It has nice looking tabs, toolbars with macish looking buttons (which I turn off of course...don't need buttons crowding up my text editor!), transparent background, and key bindings to some of the more important "standard" OS X shortcuts (Cmd-o, Cmd-v, etc). It's a bunch of little things that add up to make vim feel like a native app.
