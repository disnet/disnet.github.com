>When people come to understand how big the universe is and how short a human life is, their hearts cry out. Sometimes it's a shout of joy...for most of us it's a cry of terror. The terror of extinction, the terror of meaninglessness. Our hearts cry out. Maybe to God, or maybe just to break the silence.
>-- Robert Charles Wilson *Spin*

To borrow the line from Hitchhiker's Guide, space is big. Really
big. So big it's pretty much impossible for our minds to comprehend how big it actually
is.

Wilson's characters in *Spin* are confronted with immensity in both time
and space. The basic premise
is that the earth is wrapped up in a temporal field which causes time
to slow down on earth. For each second that passes on earth, ~3 years
pass in the outside universe. This means that within a generation the
universe will age 4 billion years.

There have been few SF book that dealt with immense time, it's
mostly about the vast distances of space. Wilson is able to play with
some fascinating ideas like using time to terraform mars (send over a
few bacteria, allow evolution to work over a few million years and
presto! A livable world within a few time dilated earth years) or the
immanent destruction of earth (within a human lifespan the sun will
expand to consume the earth).

Wilson's characters are forced to deal with the immensity of the
universe. As the quote alludes, some of them respond with shouts of
joy (one character devotes his life to understanding and dealing with
the spin) and others with a cry of terror (another character winds up
in a dangerous christian millennial cult). But respond they must in
the face of the immanent immensity of the cosmos.

What is fascinating to me is that even though our conception of the
universe has expanded so quickly (it wasn't until the
[1920s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debate) that we started
to realize the universe was bigger than our galaxy) our ability to
deal with its immenseness has not. To a certain extent this makes
sense, the immediate here and now is more pressing, but I believe that
our smallness
and the universe's bigness should inform how we live our lives in the
here and now.

Carl Sagan can put it better than me:
