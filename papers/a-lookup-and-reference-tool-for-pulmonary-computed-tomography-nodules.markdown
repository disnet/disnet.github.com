abstract: 
  Picture archive and communication systems (PACS) often contain millions of images related to clinical studies
  performed at an institution.  In the current standard of practice, these images are often not annotated in
  a  standards-based,  structured  fashion  which  would  allow  retrieval  based  on  image  features  identiÔ¨Åed  by
  an expert observer.  The integration of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) into radiologist workstations
  is  important  for situations  when relevant  images  cannot  be  retrieved by  the  coarse  search  of patient  and
  study related information alone.  A content-based medical image retrieval system could be used extensively
  for  reference  and  teaching  by  providing  retrieval  of  cases  similar  to  a  given  image.   This  kind  of  system
  could  also  be  used  for  decision  support  by  retrieving  cases  with  similar  features  and  providing  assisted
  diagnosis based on known pathology in retrieved cases.  This paper describes a demonstration CBIR system
  for pulmonary nodule lookup
