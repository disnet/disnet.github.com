abstract: 
  Automatic liver segmentation from abdominal computed tomography (CT) images based on gray levels or shape alone is 
  difficult because of the overlap in gray-level ranges and the variation in position and shape of the soft tissues. To address 
  these issues, we propose an automatic liver segmentation method that utilizes low-level features based on texture 
  information; this texture information is expected to be homogenous and consistent across multiple slices for the same organ. 
  Our proposed approach consists of the following steps, first, we perform pixel-level texture extraction; second, we generate 
  liver probability images using a binary classification approach; third, we apply a split-and-merge algorithm to detect the seed
  set with the highest probability area; and fourth, we apply to the seed set a region growing algorithm iteratively to refine the
  liverâ€™s boundary and get the final segmentation results. Furthermore, we compare the segmentation results from three 
  different texture extraction methods (Co-occurrence Matrices, Gabor filters, and Markov Random Fields (MRF)) to find the 
  texture method that generates the best liver segmentation. From our experimental results, we found that the co-occurrence 
  model led to the best segmentation, while the Gabor model led to the worst liver segmentation. Moreover, co-occurrence 
  texture features alone produced approximately the same segmentation results as those produced when all the texture features 
  from the combined co-occurrence, Gabor, and MRF models were used. Therefore, in addition to providing an automatic 
  model for liver segmentation, we also conclude that Haralick co-occurrence texture features are the most significant texture 
  characteristics in distinguishing the liver tissue in CT scans.
