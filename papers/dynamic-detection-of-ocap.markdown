abstract:
    In this paper we present a new tool called DOCaT (Dynamic Object
    Capability Tracer), a model checker for JavaScript that detects
    capability leaks in an object capability system. DOCaT includes an
    editor that highlights the sections of code that can be potentially
    transferred to untrusted third-party code along with a trace showing
    how the code could be leaked in an actual execution. This code
    highlighting provides a simple way of visualizing the references
    untrusted code potentially has access to and helps programmers to
    discover if their code is leaking more capabilities then required.



    DOCaT is implemented using a combination of source code
    rewriting (using Sweet.js, a JavaScript macro system), dynamic behavioral
    intercession (Proxies, introduced in ES6, the most recent
    version of JavaScript), and model checking. Together these methods
    are able to locate common ways for untrusted code to elevate
    its authority.
