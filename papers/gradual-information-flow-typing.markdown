abstract: 
  We present a method to support the gradual evolution of secure
  scripts by formalizing an extension of the simply-typed lambda
  calculus that provides information flow constructs. These constructs
  allow initially insecure programs to evolve via targeted refactoring
  and to provide dynamic information flow guarantees via casts, as well
  as static information flow guarantees via labeled types.
