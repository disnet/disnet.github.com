abstract: 
  The potential for unexpected interference between threads makes multithreaded programming
  notoriously difficult.
  Programmers use a variety of synchronization idioms
  such as locks and barriers to restrict where interference may actually occur.
  Unfortunately, the resulting _actual_ interference points
  are typically never documented and must be manually reconstructed as the first step in
  any subsequent programming task (code review, refactoring, etc).


  This paper proposes explicitly documenting actual interference points
  in the program source code, and it presents a type and effect system for
  verifying the correctness of these interference specifications.


  Experimental results on a variety of Java benchmarks show that this
  approach provides a significant improvement over prior systems based
  on method-level atomicity specifications.  In particular, it reduces
  the number of interference points one must consider from several
  hundred points per thousand lines of code to roughly 13 per thousand
  lines of code. Explicit interference points also serve to highlight all known
  concurrency defects in these benchmarks.
